# Loading and displaying an image


# Basic Operations on images


# Arithmetic Operations on images
- when blending two images, the shape of both must be the same (and resized otherwise) when using:
<td>
   <pre lang="python">
   dst = cv2.addWeighted(img1,0.5,resized_img2,0.3,0)
   </pre>
</td>


<code> dst = cv2.addWeighted(img1,0.5,resized_img2,0.3,0) </code>
